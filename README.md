# My-First-Project
My project is a questionaire based project. It tests to see how much knowledge you have about the Covid-19 Pandemic.
To operate my project you need to answer the questions to see how much you know about Covid-19. If you answer the question correctly you get a point. If you answer the question incorrect you don't get a point and it tells you what the correct answer is. At the end of the questionaire it tally's up your score and tells you how you did.
There were no modules that was used or needed to be installed to complete this program it was all coding.
The additional steps I would take if I had more time is to create a game of my own with impecable coding and GUI's. I just want to challenge myself and learn everything there possible is to be successful at programming and successful in this industry.
