# My-First-Project
My project is a questionaire based project. It is testing to see how much you know about the Covid-19 Pandemic.
To operate my project you just answer the questions to see how much you know about Covid-19. If you get the answer correct you get a point. If you get the answer wrong you don't get a point and it tells you what the correct answer is if you get the question incorrect. At the end of the questionaire it tally's up your score and tells you how you did.
There were no modules that needed it be installed it was just all coding.

The additional steps I would take if I had more time is just create a code and have lots of graphics.
